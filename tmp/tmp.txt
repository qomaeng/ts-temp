I'll help you implement the AI chat assistant component in plain HTML and CSS while maintaining the design and functionality. Let me plan the integration first.

1. Analysis:
- The design shows a floating chat assistant button that expands into a full chat interface
- Uses vanilla JS for interactivity and state management
- Requires Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Needs custom animations and particle effects
- Must be accessible and semantic

2. Files needed:
- chat.html - Main component HTML structure
- chat.css - Component styles including animations
- chat.js - Vanilla JS functionality and utilities

3. Implementation details:
